<i>Previously on AMC's
"The Walking Dead"...</i>

2
00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:06.558
And on this day,
we begin to reshape this world.

3
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:13.665
Y'all can live
if you surrender right now.

4
00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.377
No matter what comes next,
we've won.

5
00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.679
We've already won!

6
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:29.914
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

8
00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.281
Let's hurry it up, fishies.

9
00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.016
We got our pants down out here.

10
00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:14.285
It's only like a dozen.

11
00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:18.923
Yeah, I mean...
Huck.

12
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.693
Relieve Todd
at the maintenance station.

13
00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:23.194
- Hey, Mara...
- Shut up.

14
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.063
Give me your gun.

15
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.433
How's that feel?

16
00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:30.969
It, uh, feels...
Shut up.

17
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.137
Go inside. Get the coolers.
Start packing up.

18
00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:36.875
Hey, genius.

19
00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:40.845
Sorry.

20
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.580
Go.

21
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.992
Little Roy.

22
00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:01.366
Little Roy, it's Mara.
You copy?

23
00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.840
J-Top, it's Mara.
You copy?

24
00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:15.313
Todd?

25
00:03:17.784 --> 00:03:19.784
Yeah?

26
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.123
Lock the stairwell, every floor.

27
00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:27.393
Why?

28
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:22.144

29
00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:35.563
Looks like
they made themselves a moat.

30
00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:42.130
I guess we shouldn't be
surprised, considering.

31
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.784
We can do this.
We did before.

32
00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:48.955
Yeah.
That's what I was considering.

33
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.090
I wasn't here before.

34
00:04:52.304 --> 00:04:54.505
Just need a clear shot.
Right, Dianne?

35
00:04:56.342 --> 00:04:57.941
Just a few seconds.

36
00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:01.145
So we just need
to time it right.

37
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.582
They see us, they fire a gun,
we're not getting in.

38
00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:11.021
Don't let them fire a gun,
Dianne.

39
00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:17.928
Morgan, do you need us
to cover you or something?

40
00:05:17.963 --> 00:05:20.230
I do not.

41
00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:23.500
Hey, we're here to help.
It shouldn't just be you.

42
00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:27.137
I don't die.

43
00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:45.756
Your majesty!

44
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.758
Where is he?

45
00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:49.793
Find the King!

46
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:24.428
The damned are upon us!

47
00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:27.798
Protect the King!

48
00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:29.499
Protect yourselves!

49
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.455
Anyone see where he went?

50
00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:56.059
He saw us.

51
00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:59.363
If he tells them we're here,
it's over before it started.

52
00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:02.399
It is not, and he won't,

53
00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:05.836
for we together
will find him, end him,

54
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.338
and fulfill the promise
of what we have begun.

55
00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:11.708
Trust the King.

56
00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:14.845
Outpost is due north,
through the woods.

57
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.914
As that's surely his course,
so shall it be ours.

58
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.517
If our comrades had already
arrived, they'd have been here.

59
00:07:20.552 --> 00:07:21.952
Return to the staging area.

60
00:07:21.987 --> 00:07:23.687
Gather the others
when they land.

61
00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:26.356
And if they haven't yet,
release Shiva from her cage.

62
00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:28.759
Due north.
We'll leave a trail for you.

63
00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:31.361
Ensure no enemies remain
in these environs,

64
00:07:31.397 --> 00:07:32.763
and be not 10 minutes behind.

65
00:07:32.798 --> 00:07:33.764
Go.

66
00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:36.099
- Onward!
- Whoo!

67
00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:39.469
To our foe,
then to his compound,

68
00:07:39.505 --> 00:07:41.471
then to certain victory.

69
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.100
Spread out!
Watch for breaches!

70
00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:13.003
We keep 'em locked in, they got
bigger problems than us.

71
00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:18.775
I can hear the shooting.

72
00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:20.077
Stay where you are.

73
00:08:20.112 --> 00:08:22.079
Do not say another word.

74
00:08:22.114 --> 00:08:23.080
Ugh!

75
00:08:23.115 --> 00:08:24.115
Ohh!

76
00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:46.503
You signal
if they're already inside.

77
00:08:46.538 --> 00:08:47.637
We'll be there.

78
00:08:47.673 --> 00:08:50.841
Come on.
Let's find them guns.

79
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.458
Dino, we need an opening.
Find one or make one.

80
00:09:40.926 --> 00:09:42.826
What the hell?

81
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:44.694
Hey!

82
00:10:04.783 --> 00:10:05.849
Ugh!

83
00:10:05.884 --> 00:10:07.884
Ohh!

84
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:44.514
Ain't on this floor.

85
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.316
Only option is up.

86
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.318
High ground.
Good cover.

87
00:11:48.353 --> 00:11:50.220
Yeah, I'd put them
up there, too.

88
00:11:50.255 --> 00:11:51.454
Stairs.

89
00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.979
They're too chickenshit
to move in on us.

90
00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:18.415
We push them back!
Go!

91
00:12:37.369 --> 00:12:39.569
We got some coming up
on my right.

92
00:12:39.605 --> 00:12:42.238
Stay on them!
Don't let them through!

93
00:12:42.274 --> 00:12:43.707
We pin them in,
it takes care of itself!

94
00:12:43.742 --> 00:12:44.841
That's the plan!

95
00:13:16.808 --> 00:13:19.309
Tobin, move in!

96
00:13:19.344 --> 00:13:20.877
I can take them!
Cover me!

97
00:13:20.912 --> 00:13:22.312
No!
Wait for Tobin!

98
00:13:22.347 --> 00:13:24.214
There's no time!

99
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.418
Go!
I'll help cover you!

100
00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:52.481
Last floor.

101
00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:53.716
The guns have gotta be up here.

102
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:55.918
He said they'd be here.

103
00:14:55.953 --> 00:14:58.220
Everything else he passed you
is checking out.

104
00:14:58.255 --> 00:15:00.589
That guy's a piece of shit.

105
00:15:00.624 --> 00:15:02.191
Those guns get to the Sanctuary,

106
00:15:02.226 --> 00:15:06.061
they could cut through those
walkers and free up an exit.

107
00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:08.230
We'll go faster if we split up.

108
00:15:08.265 --> 00:15:10.732
I find the M2s,
you find 'em, we use them,

109
00:15:10.768 --> 00:15:12.601
hit the courtyard
right then and there.

110
00:15:12.636 --> 00:15:14.770
End this quick.

111
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.587
Aah! Please!
Please don't shoot me!

112
00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:32.855
Shit.
Please don't shoot me.

113
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.890
- Please don't...
- Huh.

114
00:15:36.594 --> 00:15:37.860
Oh, look, you pissed your pants.

115
00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:39.394
I-I'm not one of them.

116
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.064
Uh, m-my name's Dean.

117
00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:43.532
Why are you still talking?

118
00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:46.568
Tara, wait.

119
00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:50.239
- Just wait.
- For what?

120
00:15:50.274 --> 00:15:51.807
He has his hands up, Tara.

121
00:15:51.842 --> 00:15:54.209
We have a job to do.

122
00:15:56.847 --> 00:15:59.081
You want to go check that out?

123
00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:12.461
We're missing some people
from the other team.

124
00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:14.129
Morgan?

125
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.966
Come out.

126
00:16:24.875 --> 00:16:27.843
Just stay in there.

127
00:16:27.878 --> 00:16:29.244
We're on top of each other here.

128
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.479
We'll signal you
when it's clear.

129
00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:32.481
Just be ready.

130
00:16:38.556 --> 00:16:39.955
I got it, Jesus.
Step aside.

131
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.156
Tara.

132
00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:42.491
There's a firefight outside.

133
00:16:42.526 --> 00:16:43.926
We don't even know
if Morgan's alive.

134
00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.427
Please, lady.
I'm not one of them.

135
00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:47.329
You're here. You had a gun.
You are one of them.

136
00:16:47.364 --> 00:16:49.097
I'm not. I'm not.
You got to believe me.

137
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.198
Then what are you doing here?

138
00:16:50.234 --> 00:16:52.467
I'm just a worker.

139
00:16:52.503 --> 00:16:53.936
They brought me
from the Sanctuary

140
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:56.171
to cook, clean, whatever.

141
00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:58.040
They did not give me a choice.

142
00:16:58.075 --> 00:17:00.809
They made me leave
my wife and kids.

143
00:17:03.847 --> 00:17:08.183
Your people do this
to the Sanctuary, too?

144
00:17:08.218 --> 00:17:09.351
The families okay?

145
00:17:09.386 --> 00:17:11.620
We don't want to hurt
the workers.

146
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.288
We're not going to.
You believe him?

147
00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:14.823
It's not about him.

148
00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:15.958
I'm not gonna shoot someone
with their hands up,

149
00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.693
and I'm not letting you.

150
00:17:17.728 --> 00:17:21.363
These medical supplies --
they're the Hilltop's, right?

151
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:26.201
Maggie's prenatals.

152
00:17:26.236 --> 00:17:28.670
They took them
because they could,

153
00:17:28.706 --> 00:17:29.805
because they don't give a shit.

154
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.139
So why should we?

155
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.307
I know they killed
your girlfriend...

156
00:17:32.343 --> 00:17:34.042
Jesus --
...that you loved her.

157
00:17:34.078 --> 00:17:36.211
This isn't you.
It is now.

158
00:17:36.246 --> 00:17:37.746
We're not here for revenge.

159
00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:38.847
It can't be about that.

160
00:17:38.882 --> 00:17:40.215
It can.

161
00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:42.718
Aah!

162
00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:50.626
I wouldn't.

163
00:17:52.596 --> 00:17:54.162
You know what's funny?

164
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.599
Normally I'd peg you
as the softie, not pretty boy.

165
00:17:57.635 --> 00:18:01.670
You know how hard it is
to piss yourself on purpose?

166
00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:04.640
I-It's like your dick knows
you're wearing pants.

167
00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:12.280
Aw, hell, look that.

168
00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:14.883
Well, that shit is ruined.

169
00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:19.287
Well, looks like that dumb bitch
Maggie and her kid

170
00:18:19.323 --> 00:18:22.024
are just gonna die, anyway,

171
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.358
Just like you two.

172
00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:24.426
I'm gonna kill you.

173
00:18:24.461 --> 00:18:26.294
Oh, honey, no, you're not.

174
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.363
Then someone else will.
There's too many of us.

175
00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:30.098
See, that's where we differ.

176
00:18:30.134 --> 00:18:31.633
If I take the two of you
with me,

177
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:34.136
then I've got one hell
of an insurance policy.

178
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.871
So why don't you put
that thing down

179
00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:39.408
unless you're gonna shoot
through this beautiful man here.

180
00:18:39.443 --> 00:18:41.910
I'm not gonna ask you again.

181
00:18:41.945 --> 00:18:42.911
I think she's gonna shoot you.

182
00:18:42.946 --> 00:18:44.079
I am.

183
00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.714
Yeah.
She is.

184
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:46.882
Shut up!

185
00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:47.983
Tara --
I can do it.

186
00:18:48.018 --> 00:18:49.051
Tara, he has a gun to my head.

187
00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.152
Not for long.

188
00:18:50.187 --> 00:18:51.253
Wait. Wait.
Wait a second.

189
00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:52.654
Go to hell.
Okay.

190
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.991
So you really
wanna risk it, huh?

191
00:18:56.026 --> 00:18:58.226
Me for him?

192
00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:00.162
Well, I can tell you right now
that I am not worth it.

193
00:19:00.197 --> 00:19:02.464
We can work this out.

194
00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:05.467
I-I may talk a big game
like I'm a tough guy,

195
00:19:05.502 --> 00:19:06.968
but I'm not.

196
00:19:07.004 --> 00:19:09.171
I really just want to...

197
00:19:23.487 --> 00:19:26.288
You're not gonna do it.

198
00:19:26.323 --> 00:19:29.291
Not you.

199
00:19:29.326 --> 00:19:32.027
It's not about revenge.
It's about getting it done.

200
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.300
Ugh!

201
00:19:40.838 --> 00:19:42.270
What the hell are you doing?

202
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:43.972
He tried to kill us.

203
00:19:44.007 --> 00:19:46.341
I told you --
it's not about him.

204
00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:48.510
So he gets to live?

205
00:19:48.545 --> 00:19:52.714
What about Abraham?
Glenn? Denise?

206
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.549
This is different.

207
00:19:54.585 --> 00:19:56.952
You're not Rick.
You're not Maggie.

208
00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.286
No.

209
00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:00.355
But she'll hear
what I have to say.

210
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.058
Evac Sat 1! Evac Sat 1!

211
00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.895
Jesus! Tara!

212
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:13.802
They're falling back!

213
00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.573
Go! Go! Go!

214
00:20:18.609 --> 00:20:21.309
There another way out of here?

215
00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:23.979
Yeah.
Follow my lead.

216
00:21:55.137 --> 00:21:56.870
- Tobin!
- I'm okay!

217
00:21:56.905 --> 00:21:59.406
Just keep going!
I'm okay!

218
00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:18.591
They didn't
have to move in on us.

219
00:22:18.627 --> 00:22:19.993
Shit.

220
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.599
Aah!

221
00:22:43.518 --> 00:22:45.018
Up ahead.

222
00:22:45.053 --> 00:22:46.319
I see it.

223
00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:48.121
This is me.

224
00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:02.702
What befell this creature?

225
00:23:07.142 --> 00:23:09.943
I mean before you.

226
00:23:09.978 --> 00:23:12.846
We don't have time
to figure that out.

227
00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:14.547
Compound's not far off.

228
00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:16.216
If he made it,

229
00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:18.818
if they know we're coming,
they're gonna be ready.

230
00:23:20.222 --> 00:23:23.490
Two possibilities,
just one fact.

231
00:23:25.894 --> 00:23:27.460
And what's that?

232
00:23:27.496 --> 00:23:29.829
We shall be ready regardless.

233
00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:36.403
What's about to happen,
it's not just a few walkers.

234
00:23:36.438 --> 00:23:38.004
You know that, right?

235
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.940
Yes.
And yet I smile.

236
00:23:42.344 --> 00:23:44.110
Why?

237
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.084
Do I feel the supreme
confidence?

238
00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:53.720
Or is my lot, my job,

239
00:23:53.755 --> 00:23:57.991
to simply protect
such certainty?

240
00:23:58.026 --> 00:24:00.727
No and yes.

241
00:24:00.762 --> 00:24:02.829
Yes and no.

242
00:24:02.864 --> 00:24:05.031
And then finally yes to both.

243
00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:11.337
Fake it till you make it, baby.

244
00:24:11.373 --> 00:24:14.774
That's what I've done
and what I do.

245
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.610
I am King because
I-I have provided a light

246
00:24:17.646 --> 00:24:19.946
to lead my people forward
through the darkness,

247
00:24:19.981 --> 00:24:23.116
and they have made
my fictions realities.

248
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:25.919
So, with all this and everything
that's happened --

249
00:24:25.954 --> 00:24:29.122
All of us may not make it.

250
00:24:29.157 --> 00:24:30.423
We may not even win.

251
00:24:30.459 --> 00:24:33.259
And yet I smile.

252
00:24:33.295 --> 00:24:36.896
There will be no fantasies
of failure this day.

253
00:24:36.932 --> 00:24:40.567
Hey, guys.
Is this blood from the wasted?

254
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.743
No.

255
00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:53.413
One of us hit him
when we fired on him.

256
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:55.215
Means he's moving slow.

257
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.916
Hells yeah.

258
00:24:56.952 --> 00:24:58.118
We're back in business.

259
00:24:58.153 --> 00:24:59.552
Well done, Daniel.

260
00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:01.321
Well done to us all.

261
00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:04.457
We move forward...

262
00:25:04.493 --> 00:25:07.293
as we move
the very world forward.

263
00:28:07.709 --> 00:28:09.976
The M2s.
Where are they?

264
00:28:10.011 --> 00:28:14.247
No...guns!

265
00:28:14.282 --> 00:28:15.815
Grace--

266
00:28:17.485 --> 00:28:18.951
They're in there?

267
00:28:19.988 --> 00:28:22.855
No! No!

268
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:24.257
Ohh!

269
00:28:44.813 --> 00:28:46.079
Aaaah!

270
00:29:00.328 --> 00:29:05.998
<i>You sure we can do it?
We can beat 'em?</i>

271
00:29:14.876 --> 00:29:18.044
<i>What this group has done,
what we've learned,</i>

272
00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:22.248
<i>what we've become, all of us --
yes, I'm sure.</i>

273
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:29.822
Ugh!

274
00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:47.607
Circle the door, wide,
at least 20 feet.

275
00:29:47.642 --> 00:29:49.075
Guns up, but hold your fire.

276
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.076
What?

277
00:29:50.111 --> 00:29:51.344
They're gonna give up.

278
00:29:51.379 --> 00:29:52.712
We only fire if they fire first.

279
00:29:52.747 --> 00:29:54.614
They fire first, one of us dies.

280
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:58.384
Then let's hope, for my sake,
that they don't.

281
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.787
You can try to stop me.

282
00:30:00.822 --> 00:30:04.123
Come on! Go! Move!

283
00:30:07.562 --> 00:30:09.295
Drop your weapon!

284
00:30:11.232 --> 00:30:14.066
Drop your weapon and surrender.

285
00:30:26.648 --> 00:30:27.880
Living sounds good to me.

286
00:30:30.185 --> 00:30:31.784
We're surrounded.

287
00:30:35.023 --> 00:30:36.422
Don't be as dumb
as they think we are.

288
00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:38.825
Put your guns down.

289
00:30:41.963 --> 00:30:44.897
It's okay.

290
00:30:44.933 --> 00:30:46.332
We can do it the hard way.

291
00:30:46.367 --> 00:30:48.167
Because even if Maggie
listens to you,

292
00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:50.570
Rick will listen to me.

293
00:31:23.872 --> 00:31:25.838
Ugh!

294
00:31:45.193 --> 00:31:49.629
<i>We have to come for them
before they come for us.</i>

295
00:31:49.664 --> 00:31:51.797
<i>We can't leave them alive.</i>

296
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.904
<i>Where there's life,
there's possibility.</i>

297
00:31:57.939 --> 00:32:00.506
<i>Of them hitting us.</i>

298
00:32:00.542 --> 00:32:05.678
Shit.
I know you.

299
00:32:05.713 --> 00:32:07.346
You get transferred, too?

300
00:32:09.017 --> 00:32:10.416
Morgan!

301
00:32:11.886 --> 00:32:15.021
Lower your gun.

302
00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:20.726
We came here to kill them.

303
00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:28.434
We're<i> supposed</i> to.

304
00:32:28.469 --> 00:32:31.537
They surrendered.

305
00:32:31.573 --> 00:32:34.674
It's not what we do.

306
00:32:46.321 --> 00:32:49.088
Then what do we do, huh?

307
00:33:07.908 --> 00:33:09.174
Hmm.

308
00:33:39.673 --> 00:33:41.407
Gracie.

309
00:33:41.442 --> 00:33:43.542
Gracie.

310
00:33:43.577 --> 00:33:45.544
No.

311
00:33:47.615 --> 00:33:49.248
No.

312
00:34:38.933 --> 00:34:41.266
That way.

313
00:34:49.276 --> 00:34:51.710
There!

314
00:35:06.327 --> 00:35:08.494
Save your munitions, Carol.

315
00:35:11.432 --> 00:35:12.998
Our friends have arrived.

316
00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:35.821
Ugh!

317
00:35:35.856 --> 00:35:36.856
Aah!

318
00:35:53.174 --> 00:35:55.040
Ahh.

319
00:35:55.075 --> 00:35:57.009
Francine!

320
00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:54.666
You okay? You okay?

321
00:36:54.702 --> 00:36:58.937
I'm fine, but our people --
they need...

322
00:37:01.442 --> 00:37:03.675
Oh, God.
No.

323
00:37:03.711 --> 00:37:05.110
No, no, no, no, no, no.

324
00:37:05.145 --> 00:37:07.079
No, no.
Eric, Eric.

325
00:37:07.114 --> 00:37:09.381
Eric.

326
00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:11.283
Let's go.

327
00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:21.838
And there it is --
our certain victory.

328
00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:31.781
This -- I am not glad
for his death.

329
00:37:31.817 --> 00:37:32.910
For anyone's.

330
00:37:33.209 --> 00:37:34.209
I know.

331
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.218
Nelson, we're on the move,
taking active measures.

332
00:37:44.253 --> 00:37:45.786
Just hole up, keep it elevated,

333
00:37:45.821 --> 00:37:47.988
and if you see us,
stay out of the line of fire.

334
00:37:50.392 --> 00:37:53.026
Jig's up.
Gonna have to break chocks.

335
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.595
No.

336
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.264
This journey will not end
in retreat.

337
00:37:57.299 --> 00:37:59.466
But they know we're coming.

338
00:38:02.471 --> 00:38:04.771
Indeed they do.

339
00:38:45.481 --> 00:38:47.681
Damn it.

340
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:51.585
Keep your hands down.

341
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.087
Turn around slow.

342
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:11.772
Hi, Rick.

343
00:39:15.678 --> 00:39:20.314
Your name...

344
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:22.916
is Morales.

345
00:39:24.753 --> 00:39:27.688
You were in Atlanta.

346
00:39:29.491 --> 00:39:32.559
That was a long time ago.

347
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:38.165
It's over, Rick.

348
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.866
I called the Saviors back.

349
00:39:41.403 --> 00:39:44.204
And they're coming.

350
00:41:21.409 --> 00:41:27.185
